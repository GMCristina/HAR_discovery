# HAR_discovery
This repository contains the code of an HAR (Human Activity Recognition) application developed as a project for the course of "Sistemi Operativi Dedicati". 
This application uses the sensor data from a 3D accelerometer (sensor MPU-6050) to recognize the activity of the user (Walking,Jogging,Sitting,Standing,Upstairs,Downstairs) with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) running on the board STM32F429I-DISC1.
The detailed description of the project can be found in the report file "RelazioneSODBruttiGiannini.pdf".
